## Heart Problem Prediction Algorithm

This project explores the application of the Knowledge Discovery in Databases (KDD) process to predict heart problems based on an individual's habits and health indicators.

## Project Overview

This is a semester project for Biomedical Technology class at the University of West Attica. 
The goal is to develop a model that can predict the likelihood of heart problems by analyzing various factors related to a person's lifestyle and health metrics.

## Repository Structure

- `Code`: 
  - `1. All Data Preprocessing & Transformation.py`: Data preprocessing and K-means clustering visualization for health indicators.
  - `2. K-Means Clustering.py`: Comprehensive data cleaning and preparation of BRFSS 2015 dataset for heart disease analysis.
  - `3.  Data Mining with Classification.py`: Implementation of Decision Tree classification on BRFSS 2015 heart disease indicators.
- `Documentation`: Contains detailed documentation about the assignment and project origin.
  - `BRFSS 2015 Codebook Report`: Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System dataset, collected through phone survey, regarding peoples habits.
  - `Biomedical Technology Assognment`: The technical essay submitted, walking through the staps of Knowledge Discovery in Databases (KDD) Process.
  - `heart_disease_health_indicators_BRFSS2015 (Cleaned Data Spreadsheet).csv`: A cleaner version created from BRFSS 2015 Codebook Report.

## KDD Process Application

This project follows the KDD process:

1. Data Collection
2. Data Preprocessing
3. Data Transformation
4. Data Mining
5. Interpretation/Evaluation

Each step is implemented and documented in the corresponding Python files and documentation.
